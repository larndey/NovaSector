**This repository contains sexually explicit content and is not suitable for those under the age of 18.**

*Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!*

ExoNova is a "fork of a fork" of Nova Sector and does not keep up with the main branch every time it updates.
Changes made to ExoNova include nitpicky bug fixes, new NPCs, significantly altered lore texts, and other various changes.

I would strongly suggest contributing to the original NovaSector repo instead of this one.
