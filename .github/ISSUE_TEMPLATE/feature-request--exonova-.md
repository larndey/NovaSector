**READ THIS - MUST CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING**
- [ ] I confirm that the feature(s) I am requesting be added/changed IS NOT a part of unmodified NovaSector. Suggesting changes to ExobytechNova that are caused by version differences is not a valid feature request; ONLY suggest changes where the solution isn't "update NovaSector to latest"
- [ ] I confirm that the feature(s) I am requesting be added/changed HAVE NOT been suggested by another user already.
- [ ] I solemnly swear that if I am lying, I am a big idiot and may be blocked from contributing to ExobytechNova by its developers as a direct consequence of my misdeeds.
